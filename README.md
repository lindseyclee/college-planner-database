# college-planner-database

**Course:** CPSC 408 - Database Management (SQL)

## Overview:

This application aims to help students determine what classes are offered at each college based on the degree program or professor. It serves as a tool to aid students in planning, researching, and comparing college degree program to find the right fit OR plan classes. We've developed a sample database of degree programs, professors, and courses at Chapman University that we've connected to a front-end application, using stream lit.

## Features:

The user can:
* Create a Student or Professor Account
* Browse colleges and their degree programs (we only have Chapman University accessible for test purposes)
* Look up all the courses a professor teaches

## Tables:

* Student
* Professor
* Course
* College
* Degree Program

## Tech Stack:

* **Front End:** stream lit to build the user application
* **Back End:** python and MySQL

## Additional Notes:

* I collaborated on this project in a team of three, with Diego Fondevilla & Ethan Santana.
